        <h1>Short Bio:</h1>
        <p>I'm an undergraduate student at McGill University in my 4th year studying jazz voice and music technology. I'm also currently an audio engineering intern at Wicked Squid Studios in Rochester, NY. I write and perform my own compositions under the name Lucy's Mirror. I like jazz a lot but I'm also interested in R&B and hip hop.</p>
